# Smart-Contracts
Smart contracts for a Smart Wallet, ERC20 Token, and Token Marketplace. The wallet offers secure token management; the ERC20 contract provides standard token features; and the marketplace enables decentralized token trading. Built using Solidity and OpenZeppelin libraries.
I am planning to integrate my voting with a real time wallet and voting would be backed by ERC20.
